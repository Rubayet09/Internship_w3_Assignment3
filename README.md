# Node.js Internship Assignment 3

This repository contains **Assignment 3** for the Node.js Internship program. The project highlights the implementation of advanced Node.js concepts, including API design, middleware usage, and database integration.

## Project Overview

The project demonstrates:

- Middleware for request/response handling
- Integration with a database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL)
- Advanced routing with parameterized endpoints
- Modular and scalable project architecture

## Key Features

- **Middleware Integration**: Logging, error handling, and request validation.
- **Database Operations**: CRUD operations integrated with a database.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Flexible routing with parameters.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular structure for easier maintenance and scalability.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Database of choice (e.g., [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/))

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rubayet09/Internship_w3_Assignment3.git
cd Internship_w3_Assignment3
npm install
```

Set up the database by configuring the connection string in the `config/` directory.

## Usage

Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint         | Description                 |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/items`     | Retrieve all items          |
| GET    | `/api/items/:id` | Retrieve a single item by ID|
| POST   | `/api/items`     | Create a new item           |
| PUT    | `/api/items/:id` | Update an item by ID        |
| DELETE | `/api/items/:id` | Delete an item by ID        |
